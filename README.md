# CTA-Strategy
This strategy is primarily aimed at the Chinese futures market, conducting research across various sectors including black metals, non-ferrous metals, energy and chemicals, agricultural products, precious metals, and stock indices. It employs four factors: momentum in time series, cross-sectional momentum, term structure, and position holding volume, to predict prices and conduct trades for commodities with good liquidity within different sectors.
